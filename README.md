How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  I receive customer feedback for features that are wanted and create user stories that reflect the customer's needs. I develop user stories with specific requirements so that a tester can build cases that will implement the features into a program. These stories are labeled with their priority and what actions the user will take to get results. Once the stories are laid out and a tester creates test cases, the developer can implement the features into the program. Once the code is implemented the tester can refer to the cases and user stories to see if they meet the requirements.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I approach development with the user stories and test cases in mind so that I know what features to implement and in what order. I can use agile planning to setup a board with what stories I will implement during each sprint along with practices like poker-planning to decide value and order of stories to implement. I can use agile methodology when changes are made to the product backlog and adapt the program as needed. I would use the daily scrum meetings to communicate what I did the day before, what I will do next, and what impediments I have run into.
