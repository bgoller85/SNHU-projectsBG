\\Corner Grocer App Reflection\\

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project was for a grocery store to see what items their customers purchased the most. It took an input file and read items to see how many times each item appeared. It then outputted the item name and frequency using menu options for the user to choose from that allowed them to either pick an item and see it's frequency, print the full list of items with their numerical frequency, print the list in histogram form and an option to exit the menu. This also output a text file with item names and their frequency.
  
2. What did you do particularly well?
My code utilized classes and functions very well so that the only code in my main function was to call the other functions.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could maybe make the classes in different header files so that if I needed to grow the program I could just include those header files and inherit from the function classes to create new specific functions like lableling the items into seperate categories so that the user could see the frequency of fruits or vegetables etc. 

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The map function was new to me and I had to flip back through the zybooks lecture on the matter and I referenced some examples in stackoverflow.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Many programming languages are similar, so the skills from this project could help with java or python projects as well

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used switch cases instead of if-else statements for my menu functions for a cleaner code appearance and faster functionality. It would also be easier to make changes the menu this way. I added in-line comments to help with understanding the funciton of my code.


//Software Development Lifecycle//

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  I receive customer feedback for features that are wanted and create user stories that reflect the customer's needs. I develop user stories with specific requirements so that a tester can build cases that will implement the features into a program. These stories are labeled with their priority and what actions the user will take to get results. Once the stories are laid out and a tester creates test cases, the developer can implement the features into the program. Once the code is implemented the tester can refer to the cases and user stories to see if they meet the requirements.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I approach development with the user stories and test cases in mind so that I know what features to implement and in what order. I can use agile planning to setup a board with what stories I will implement during each sprint along with practices like poker-planning to decide value and order of stories to implement. I can use agile methodology when changes are made to the product backlog and adapt the program as needed. I would use the daily scrum meetings to communicate what I did the day before, what I will do next, and what impediments I have run into.
  
3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  -Be respectful of others
  -Commit to the project
  -Accept responsibility and be accountable
  -Work collaboratively and make decisions with the team
  -Recognize and celebrate individual and team accomplishments
  -Provide feedback in a constructive manner and don't take offense to constructive feedback
  -Abide by the agile manifesto values
  -Be on time and productive
